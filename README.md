## What it does
Street Cleaner is a mobile game that promotes cleanliness and proper waste disposal. By making players pick up waste from the street and dispose of them into the proper bins, it trains the memory on where to dispose of certain waste items in a fun and entertaining way. At the end of the game, players are told which waste item they struggled with the most and where it belongs. This helps players remember where waste items belong and they can apply what they learned in the game IRL.

## How I built it
This game was built using Unity3D as the game engine. I added function to the game using C# scripts. The models used in the game were made using Blender.

## Challenges I ran into
The largest challenge I faced during this hackathon was the time. Game dev is time consuming and I didn't have much time left to work on the presentation of the game.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish within the time I was given.
üèÜWon 2nd place at GameHACKS 1.0

## What I learned
I learned new functions in Unity and C# and I also feel I have improved my 3D modelling skills.

## What's next for Street Cleaner
I plan on adding more sound effects and visual effects. It could also use more common makes mechanics such as a pause button. The game could also be improved by adding random events such as a raccoon that throws waste back out of the bins.
